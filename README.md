## OVERVIEW
The Toronto Parking Authority is a local Board of the City of Toronto which owns and operates the system of Municipal off-street parking lots ('Green P') and the on-street metered parking. Approximately 2.8 million parking tickets are issued annually across the City of Toronto. The Issued Parking Tickets dataset contains non-identifiable information relating to each parking ticket issued for each calendar year. The tickets are issued by Toronto Police Services (TPS) personnel as well as persons certified and authorized to issue tickets by TPS.
In this assessment, we are given different datasets related to cityofToronto parking infraction types. We are having diferent datasets as csv and geojson files.

## AIM
 The main aim is to determine the top20 infraction types most common location of city of Tronto where parkng law is voialted.
## Analysis
Using the ETL process,

Extract
 * extracted the PArking tags from 2016-2020 from Toronto open data catalogue
 * extracted green p parking data from toronto parking authority open data catalogue

Transform
 * Parking_tags

   * Using python panadas library to load and read  25 csv files.
   * using pd.concat to combine te csv files into one dataframe.
   * stored the location2 column and infraction code and infraction description for top 20 locations in        parking_top20.csv file.

 * Green P Parking
   * Used python json library to load and read json file.
   * used a for loop for collecting parking_id, address and rate and stored in the corresponding list.
   * stored address by selecting address column in a list.

Load
 * loaded both the dataframes as combined with the most common infraction types with the location2 and addresss coulmn.


## Assessment Questions
1. 	What is the most common location for each of the top 20 infraction types?

Ans: 
* I generated a jupyter notebook for this question. In that I have imported all the libraries which are required for the course.
* Combined all the csv files from the open source data of parking_tags for year 2016-2020 using glob.
* concatinated all the files to read as a single dataframe.
* Lookout for the datatypes and changed the date_of _infraction column to datetime.
* Used count to determine how many of the infraction_codes has been voilated on each location.
* Calculated the maximum of the count for each infraction type for common location.
*  Created a dataframe with the top 20 location with common infraction types.
* Saved the result as a parkimg_top20.csv file.
* With the help of google API i was trying to get the latitude and longitude of the location column to get the latitude and longitude of the address.
* To generate a map for the top 20 common location we can use marker_layer for the locations with latitude and longitude and plot the masp for each type using gmaps library of python.
                       
                     

2.	Are there alternative parking options available near the common infraction locations?

Ans:
 * In this by generating a Green P Parking jupyter notebook. I was able to load and read geoJSON files for parking issue in 2019.
 * I appended the data concatenate it and upload it as dataframe.
 * In the file we are having address for differnet parking locations. changed those addresses to upper case.
 * Created a list for common address to match up with the top 20 lcation infraction types we created in the previous question. 
 * we get 33 common locations with the infraction. created a dataframe for it.
 * With the help of googlemaps API we can get the map with the closest common location of infraction. 

3.	Are there any socio-demographic trends of note in the areas with more infractions?

Ans:
 * As we can see in the neighbourhood profiles, we can see different attributes based on the demographic data.
 * If

### Results 
  We got the top20 common locations for the parking tags for the year 2016-2020 with "2075 Bayview Ave" as most common location with infraction type 3.0 and description "park on private property".




### Summary
 
 * We can compare fine couts with the parking capacity to avoid overcrowding and suggest other parking options for drivers.
 *	Research Green Pâ€™s new parking payment app and the potential impact it has on the number and types of fines issued.
